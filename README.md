This file is to create a readme for the CLI rust book I am reading through.
Goals are to learn the rust environement. 
Practice the rust programming language. 
Learn the CLI and Linux environment. 
Complete the book. Today's date is Jun 2024
I will try to complete this book in 10 weeks. 
All applications that are created in this section are for education purposes.
Nothing that I create should be utilized by other people in anyway shape or form. 
I will not be distributing this Git repository. 
I am still new to Github and don't know all the rules for this platform. 
This file may be adjusted in the future depending on the new knowledge that I obtain.
